I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at Washington University in St. Louis. I received my B.S. in Economics and B.A. in Mathematics from University of Minnesota in 2017. 

My research interest lies in Macroeconomics and Monetary Economics, Information Frictions and Environmental Economics. My current research focuses on how monetary policy information structure affects private sectors' interpretation of economic fundamentals.

I am available for the 2022-2023 economic job market.
