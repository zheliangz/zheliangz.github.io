  abstract={In reality, a central bank does not observe fundamentals within an economy and information dispersion exists among all the sectors. This paper employs a New Keynesian dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model with non-nested information and extends the information dispersion to all sectors. We study monetary polices with internalization of public expectations by means of policy-wise information implementation. Theoretically, we show that this implementation determines signal extraction processes, dynamics of macro-variables and hence macro-volatility. Numerically, we find an increasing importance in households' information with an increase in economy's information structure complexity. This paper aids in understanding impacts of policy-rule information choices .},
