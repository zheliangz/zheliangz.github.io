  title={A Belief-Driven Taylor Rule},
  author={Zhu,Zheliang},
  abstract={In reality, a central bank does not observe fundamentals within an economy and infor-
mation dispersion exists among all the sectors. This paper employs a New Keynesian
dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model with non-nested information
and extends the information dispersion to all sectors. We study monetary polices with
internalization of public expectations by means of policy-wise information implemen-
tation. Theoretically, we show that this implementation determines signal extraction
processes, dynamics of macro-variables and hence macro-volatility. Numerically, we
â€€nd an increasing importance in households' information with an increase in econ-
omy's information structure complexity. This paper aids in understanding impacts of
policy-rule information choices .}
